"""Single-source review with a local Ollama model.

prr's normal flow is dual-source: a model does its own pass while a subagent
does an independent security pass. This is deliberately NOT that. It runs one
pass (Source A only) against a local Ollama model, for an outage or for trying
a local model as a reviewer, and says so in its report.

Status (2026-09-30): no local model tested so far is accurate enough to trust
(qwen3:8b, qwen2.5-coder:7b, gemma4:26b-a4b-it-qat; no finding survived
checking, with or without capped thinking). The pipeline is kept so a new model
is one --model flag away.

The design point: a local quantized model is weakest at exactly the things a
review payload demands (strict schema, precise line numbers recalled from a
long diff, holding a procedure across many turns). So the model is given one
narrow job -- read one file's hunks, name what is wrong -- and deterministic
code owns everything else:

  - line numbers are pre-computed and handed TO the model, not asked of it
  - output is grammar-constrained by a JSON schema, so it cannot be malformed
  - every anchor is validated against the diff before it can reach GitHub
  - the verdict is derived from severities, not chosen by the model
  - the plain-ASCII prose rule is enforced by substitution, not self-check
  - the approval gate is control flow, so nothing posts without a keypress,
    or, under --save-only, without a separate --post-saved run

Mechanics are reused as-is: setup-review.sh prepares the worktree and
artifacts, post-review.sh validates the head sha, posts, signals chat, and
cleans up. Neither cares which model produced the findings.

Usage:
  prr-local.py <PR> [--model NAME] [--think | --think-budget N] [--silent] [--no-model] [--save-only]
  prr-local.py <PR> --post-saved APPROVE|APPROVE_BARE|REQUEST_CHANGES|COMMENT|DISCARD [--note TEXT]
  prr-local.py --selftest

  --model       Ollama model tag (default: $PRR_LOCAL_MODEL, else Gemma 4 26B)
  --think       Let the model reason before each file's findings. Slower,
                uncapped, and only the findings are kept, never the reasoning.
  --think-budget N  Cap the reasoning at N tokens per call (implies --think).
                At the cap the model is stopped and asked to answer from its
                notes so far, as hearth's Think setting does.
  --silent      Suppress chat signals, passed through to setup-review.sh
  --no-model    Skip inference entirely; exercises the plumbing in seconds
  --save-only   Report and save /tmp/pr-<N>-review.json, keep the worktree, stop.
                For agent harnesses: a human decides, then --post-saved posts.
  --post-saved  Post the saved review with the chosen event. Runs no model.
                post-review.sh refuses if the PR head moved since the review.
                DISCARD posts nothing: it clears the chat :eyes: and removes
                the worktree and saved review (post-review.sh cleanup only).
  --note TEXT   Your own words, appended verbatim to the end of the review body
                (any choice except DISCARD). Also applies at the interactive gate.
                `--note -` reads the text from stdin (use a quoted heredoc).

Every review run also logs to /tmp/prr-local-<N>.log as it goes (tail -f it
from another terminal); cleanup leaves the log in place.

You are reviewing one file from a pull request. Report only defects you can \
justify from the lines shown.

Every line is prefixed with its real line number in the new file, then a marker:
  `+` added by this PR, ` ` unchanged context, `-` removed.

Rules:
- `line` MUST be a number you can see in the prefix of a `+` or ` ` line. Never
  a removed line, never a number you computed yourself.
- Report a finding only if you can name the concrete input or sequence that
  makes it fail. No style preferences, no "consider extracting", no praise.
- severity: `blocker` breaks correctness or security. `notable` is a real bug in
  an edge case. `nit` is small and non-blocking.
- `body` is the comment the author will read. Plain ASCII, no em-dashes. State
  the failure, then the fix. Two or three sentences.
- An empty findings list is the correct answer for a clean file. Say nothing
  rather than inventing something.
- `cleared`: up to three short notes on what you checked and found fine.
"""

DELETED_BRIEF = """\
This file is deleted by the pull request. Every line shown is removed. Use the \
PR overview to see what else changed.

Report a finding only for a concrete problem the deletion itself causes:
- something the PR keeps still depends on what this file provided, or
- behaviour the PR description says is kept is lost with it (an auth check,
  error mapping, validation) and nothing in the overview replaces it.

Rules:
- `line` is always 0: a deleted file has no lines to comment on.
- severity and `body` follow the usual rules: name the failure, then the fix.
  Plain ASCII, no em-dashes. Two or three sentences.
- A deletion the PR intends, with nothing left depending on it, is clean:
  return an empty findings list. Say nothing rather than inventing something.
- `cleared`: up to three short notes on what you checked and found fine.
"""

SUMMARY_BRIEF = """\
Write the summary body for a pull request review, given the findings below.

- Two short paragraphs at most. Plain ASCII, no em-dashes, no bullet lists.
- Say what the change does and whether it is sound.
- Do not re-list the findings. Inline ones are posted as comments, and ones
  marked "(deleted file)" are printed in full right after your summary.
- If there are no findings, say what you checked and that it looks right.
- Write like a colleague, not a report generator. No praise padding.

Use severity `notable` for anything not fixed, `nit` for fixed.
Cite the file and line that resolves it, or say why you cannot tell.
